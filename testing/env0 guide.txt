env0 (pronounced "env zero") is an automation platform for cloud environments based on infrastructure-as-code templates. env0 combines an easy to use interface with powerful governance tools and cost control so that you, or any member of your team, can quickly and easily deploy and manage environments in the cloud. In addition, env0 provides insights as to how cloud resources are consumed in your organization, and by whom.

By integrating env0 into your processes you gain visibility, predictability, and better governance of your organization's cloud usage.

env0 is vendor-neutral and works with [these cloud platforms](https://docs.env0.com/docs/supported-platforms).

## Infrastructure-as-code and environment-as-a-service

**Infrastructure-as-code** is the management of infrastructure with a software tool (i.e., *Terraform*) which uses a model stored in configuration files to build a cloud environment. With this, you can automate the provisioning of infrastructure. This is now a key part of building a CI/CD pipeline.

The real idea behind Infrastructure-as-code, more than just deploying to staging/production, is to implement a mechanism that allows users to create fully functioning sandboxed environments outside of the CI/CD pipeline, for development, testing demos, etc.

This is called **environment-as-a-service.**

## How does env0 help in managing environment-as-a-service?

By properly structuring your infrastructure-as-code configuration, you can design it to support the CI/CD pipeline, as well as to create environments for other purposes.

env0 provides a management layer above the infrastructure-as-code software. This allows the administrator to supply environment templates (based on the infrastructure-as-code configuration), manage variables and cloud credentials, and define policies for access control, environment time-to-live, and budget limits for users.

The users get an easy-to-use interface to self-provision and manage their environments, within the policies defined by the administrators. If necessary, they can also customize deployments, according to what the policy allows, and view their deployment history and logs.

In addition to defining policies, env0 allows administrators to track environments created by users. It collects usage and cost metrics, and provides insights as to how the cloud resources are used and by whom.

## Why build your environment-as-a-service with env0?

**It saves effort**

The ability to adapt your infrastructure-as-code configuration to any type of environment is only part of an environment-as-a-service solution.

The other part is building user flows on top of it, to make it accessible to users. While it is certainly possible to build it yourself, implementing env0 is fast and easy, and can provide rich flows that you won't have to develop or maintain.

**It's easy to use**

The user flow is simple, quick to learn, and does not require a deep understanding of the underlying technology. [Test it yourself to see how easy it is](https://app.env0.com/).

**It reduces cloud spend, significantly**

A big portion of organizational cloud costs is unoptimized.

env0 helps you save in 3 ways:

- It tracks cloud spend by user and purpose, not just resource consumption. When you know who uses what, and why, you can think about improving your cloud spend.
- it allows you to limit the environment lifetime, having it automatically stopped when the time limit is reached. A surprising amount of money is being spent on environments that are no longer in use, but which have not been stopped.
- It allows you to limit cloud spend by user, team, and project.

**It gives you control**

Self-service is great. It saves time and eliminates dependencies and frustration.

But, as the organization grows, it is harder to track what is going on, but you probably want to exercise some control, while keeping it self-service.

env0 allows you to do exactly that. By setting policies, getting a real-time view of running environments, and gaining insight into cloud usage patterns, you can get all the control you want, without compromising the flexibility you give your users.

### **Move fast without breaking things**

Devs can interact with Infrastructure-as-Code in the modes they prefer including [CLI](https://docs.env0.com/docs/remote-plan), in [Git](https://docs.env0.com/docs/features), or with a [Terraform provider](https://github.com/env0/terraform-provider-env0), and their plans and applies are fully governed with powerful and [flexible IaC guardrails](https://docs.env0.com/docs/policies).

### **Blend IaC with your application development**

Infrastructure is critical to your applications and business. With env0 you can manage cloud deployments alongside existing application development pipelines. Our [IaC CI](https://docs.env0.com/docs/continuous-deployment) provides [deployment history](https://docs.env0.com/docs/plan-on-pull-request#enable-pull-request-plan), [workflow triggers,](https://docs.env0.com/docs/workflow-triggers) [visual change outputs](https://docs.env0.com/changelog/pretty-plan), and more.

Moreover, env0 [Plugins](https://docs.env0.com/docs/plugins) make it simple to tie in external tools like [tflint](https://docs.env0.com/docs/tflint-plugin), [OPA](https://docs.env0.com/docs/opa-plugin), [checkov](https://docs.env0.com/docs/checkov-plugin), and others into [Infrastructure-as-Code](https://docs.env0.com/docs/continuous-deployment)

### **Maintain Git as your IaC Source of Truth**

env0 simplifies [environment management](https://docs.env0.com/docs/setting-up-a-new-environment) by auto-generating and updating environments based on Git changes, in line with GitOps best practices. This preserves Git's integrity as the central hub for approval flows, CodeOwners details, auditability, and more.

‍

### **Gain end-to-end IaC visibility**

Get at-a-glance visibility into what [might change](https://docs.env0.com/docs/plan-on-pull-request), full [deployment history](https://docs.env0.com/docs/environments), and [audit logs](https://docs.env0.com/docs/audit-logs) to ensure you know what’s happening with your IaC at all times. Improve issue correlation and security by exporting IaC run logs to your [logging platform of choice](https://docs.env0.com/docs/integrations).

### **Maximize your IaC investment**

Seamlessly tie Infrastructure-as-Code into existing [observability platforms](https://docs.env0.com/docs/integrations), [expand access to more teams](https://docs.env0.com/docs/user-management), and increase Infrastructure as Code reuse with [RBAC](https://docs.env0.com/docs/user-management#project-roles), [private module registries](https://docs.env0.com/docs/modules), [multi-level projects](https://docs.env0.com/docs/projects), and [cost management](https://docs.env0.com/docs/cost-monitoring).

### **Create IaC-centric build pipelines**

Instead of using webhooks in Terraform Cloud, you can integrate whatever tools you need into env0’s flexible [custom flows](https://docs.env0.com/docs/custom-flows), using the tooling of your choice.

### **Measure actual cloud cost**

In addition to predicting the [estimated cost impact](https://docs.env0.com/docs/cost-monitoring?_gl=1*15zy97q*_ga*MzQzMjE4NzQ4LjE2Nzc2OTQ3MDk.*_ga_VYZFC0GDCG*MTY4MzE0MDA1MS43MC4xLjE2ODMxNDA1MDQuMjIuMC4w#cost-estimation) from every Infrastructure-as-Code change, env0 supports smart automatic tagging and follows up with [actual costs](https://docs.env0.com/docs/cost-monitoring?_gl=1*15zy97q*_ga*MzQzMjE4NzQ4LjE2Nzc2OTQ3MDk.*_ga_VYZFC0GDCG*MTY4MzE0MDA1MS43MC4xLjE2ODMxNDA1MDQuMjIuMC4w#actual-cost) once deployed. This is extremely helpful for usage based cloud resources pricing.

### **Catch issues before they hit production**

Improve customer experiences and reduce time to resolution with Infrastructure-as-Code testing and verification, pre-apply checks, [advanced drift management](https://docs.env0.com/docs/drift-detection), [IaC templates](https://docs.env0.com/docs/templates), and [clearly visible pre-apply change logs](https://docs.env0.com/changelog/pretty-plan). Troubleshooting IaC problems has never been easier.

### **Build happier teams**

Developers, DevOps, and SREs can continue to work in the tools they’re familiar with. Control your Infrastructure-as-Code with env0 via the [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/env0/env0/latest/docs), [CLI](https://docs.env0.com/docs/remote-plan), [VCS platform](https://docs.env0.com/docs/plan-and-apply-from-pr-comments), or [UI](https://app.env0.com/). And developers actually enjoy using env0 compared to other CI and IaC management tools.
